# ReductionPipeline
L-band VLA reduction pipeline

Current version works on version 6.2 of the VLA pipeline.

Pipeline scripts for older versions are maintained in separate branches
(though these are likely to be stale).

Add the repository path to the system path.
```
import sys
sys.path += ['/path/to/this/repository/']
```
Easiest to add to the `.casa/init.py` file.
